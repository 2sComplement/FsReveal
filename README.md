F#Reveal
========
## What is F#Reveal?
- [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) by _Hakim El Hattab_
- [FSharp.Formatting](https://github.com/tpetricek/FSharp.Formatting) by _Tomas Petricek_  
- F#Reveal parses fsx file (markdown & F# code) and generates reveal.js slides.

## Demo
See a sample [presentation](http://kimsk.github.io/FsReveal) that is generated from this [fsx](https://github.com/kimsk/FsReveal/blob/master/FsReveal.fsx).

## Note
You can find [code](https://github.com/kimsk/FsReveal/tree/POC/src) generating the sample presentation above as well as template and other files in the [POC](https://github.com/kimsk/FsReveal/tree/POC) (Proof-of-Concept) branch. 

This project is at a very early stage and there'd be a lot of changes in the near future.
